### .NET Framework Docker Pipeline

This repo contains a sample .NET Framework app which is built using a Dockerfile on GitHub actions.

You can refer to this Dockerfile & Workflow to replicate the same for your older .NET Framework Projects CI.

A more detailed explanation on the sections are given [on my blog post](https://vishnubhagyanath.dev/blog/dotnet-framework-docker/)
